# Cat-And-Dog-Prediction-Model
This model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to categorize photos of dogs and cats. CNNs are very good at classifying pictures as they can recognize spatial hierarchies in images. After training on a dataset of annotated photos, the model is able to identify if an image is of a dog or a cat.
