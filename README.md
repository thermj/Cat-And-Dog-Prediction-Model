Hey guys!
This is a Cat-And-Dog-Prediction-Model.
This model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to categorize photos of dogs and cats and then predict it as such. 
CNNs are very good at classifying pictures as they can recognize spatial hierarchies in images. After training on a dataset of annotated photos, the model is able to identify if an image is of a dog or a cat.

I've provided a detailed explanation of the code as well as the link for the dataset used in the code, making it easy for complete beginners to understand. 
However I recommend running the code yourself for a better learning experience.
Have fun guys.
